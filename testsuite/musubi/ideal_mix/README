Testcase: Electrical double layer (EDL)

Description: EDL is formed near the surface when the charged surface comes
in contact with the electrolyte solution. In the EDL, the solution is
non-electroneutral while in the bulk the solution is electroneutral.
This testcase is well-suited to investigate the interactions of ions migration
and its effect on electric potential distribution.

How to run this testcase:
1) Electric field as analytical solution: 
   Run 'run_musubi.sh' script to generate mesh and run Multicomponent lattice 
   Boltzmann solver-Musubi.

2) Electric field from coupled Poisson solver:
   Run 'run_apesmate.sh' script to run coupled simulation.
